    <h2>What Is Code Cactus?</h2>
    <p>
      Code Cactus is an interactive learning platform developed to support Desert CodeSprouts, an outreach initiative from ASU's School of Computing and Artificial Intelligence (SCAI). Designed to spark early interest in computing among K-12 learners, Code Cactus offers engaging modules in Coding, UI/UX Design, Machine Learning, and Cybersecurity. We bring complex computer science topics down to earth with creative, hands-on games and challenges, tailored especially for young learners.
    </p>

    <h2>How Code Cactus Supports Desert CodeSprouts' Mission</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hands-on Learning:</strong> Our modules transform abstract computing concepts into interactive experiences, making learning both accessible and fun.</li>
      <li><strong>Scalable Outreach:</strong> Our online platform allows students everywhere to engage with content—whether in ASU labs or remote classrooms throughout Arizona.</li>
      <li><strong>Faculty &amp; Student Involvement:</strong> ASU SCAI undergraduate and graduate mentors collaboratively design, test, and refine each Code Cactus game, gaining teaching experience and inspiring young students.</li>
      <li><strong>Ethical Foundations:</strong> Dedicated Cybersecurity and AI ethics content on Code Cactus instills responsible computing habits from an early age.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Program Impact</h2>
    <p>
      Since its pilot launch in 2024, the Desert CodeSprouts initiative, powered by Code Cactus, has reached over 500 middle-school students through summer workshops and after-school clubs. Student feedback shows a 40% increase in confidence with computational thinking and a 30% rise in interest toward STEM careers.
